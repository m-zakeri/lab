## Proposal Quality Assessment Checklist

A well-structured B.Sc. project proposal is essential for setting the foundation of a strong research project. Here's a quality assessment checklist tailored for computer science bachelorâ€™s thesis proposals.

Students should review each item before submitting their B.Sc. proposal to me.


### **1. General Structure and Formatting**

- [ ] Uses correct formatting style (_e.g._, IEEE, ACM, APA) as required by the department  
- [ ] Page numbering, font consistency, and margins are properly set 
- [ ] The English font size is 2pt smaller than the Persian font size
- [ ] Uses _standard styles_ in MS-Office Word or uses LaTeX engine for typesetting the proposal
- [ ] All figures and tables have captions and are referred to in the main text.

### **2. Research Problem and Objectives**
- [ ] Clearly defines a **specific research problem** and its significance in computer science
- [ ] At Least one minor contribution has been mentioned in the Introduction section.
- [ ] Objectives are **precise, achievable, and measurable**  
- [ ] Proposal states why the problem is relevant and justifies the research

### **3. Background and Literature Review**
- [ ] Provides **sufficient background** on the topic for understanding the context  
- [ ] Literature review covers **key research papers**, theories, and existing solutions  
- [ ] Identifies gaps in existing work and explains how the proposed research addresses them  
- [ ] Cites references correctly using the required citation style 
- [ ] State-of-the-art papers (published in the **last two** years) have been discussed, and their problems have been explained clearly.
- [ ] Base papers have been selected from top-tier journals and conferences in Computer Science

### **4. Proposed Methodology**
- [ ] Clearly outlines the **methodology** (_e.g._, algorithm design, software development, experimental study)  
- [ ] Specifies **data sources**, tools, technologies, frameworks, or programming languages used  
- [ ] Defines the **evaluation criteria** for success (_e.g._, performance metrics, accuracy, efficiency)  
- [ ] Identifies possible **limitations or challenges** in implementation
- [ ] Uses **standard UML diagrams** to explain the proposed approach architecture/flowchart.

### **5. Expected Outcomes and Contributions**
- [ ] States expected results and contributions to the field of computer science  
- [ ] Explains how findings will be validated (_e.g._, testing, comparative analysis, real-world applications)  
- [ ] Discusses the broader impact of the research on technology and society

### **6. Ethical and Practical Considerations**
- [ ] Addresses any **ethical concerns** related to data usage, privacy, security, or AI bias  
- [ ] Defines any **required approvals**, such as institutional ethics reviews (where possible)
- [ ] Confirms feasibility based on **available resources**, timeline, and expertise

### **7. Timeline and Work Plan**
- [ ] Presents a **clear timeline** with milestones for completion (Gantt Chart)
- [ ] Defines major phases such as research, development, testing, and documentation  
- [ ] Shows realistic scheduling to avoid delays

### **8. Writing Quality and Clarity**
- [ ] Ensures the **proposal is well-structured** and **logically flows between sections**
- [ ] Uses **concise, professional language** without grammatical errors  
- [ ] Avoids jargon or ambiguous terms that may confuse readers  

### **9. Supervisor-Specific Requirements**
- [ ] Adheres to any **guidelines set by the supervisor or department**
- [ ] Includes any additional materials (_e.g._, project requirements, feasibility study)
- [ ] The proposal has been reviewed and proofread multiple times before submission for review
