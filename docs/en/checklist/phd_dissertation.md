## Proposal Quality Assessment Checklist 

A well-structured proposal is essential for establishing a strong research foundation. This checklist helps ensure the quality of M.Sc. thesis proposals. It incorporates the higher academic standards and rigor expected of master's-level research while retaining essential structural and formatting guidelines. 

Students should review each item before submitting their M.Sc. proposal to me.

- [ ] Uses correct formatting style (_e.g._, IEEE, ACM, APA) as required by the department  
- [ ] Page numbering, font consistency, and margins are properly set  
- [ ] The English font size is 2pt smaller than the Persian font size (if bilingual)  
- [ ] Uses _standard styles_ in MS Word or a LaTeX engine for typesetting the proposal  
- [ ] All figures and tables have captions and are consistently referred to in the main text
- [ ] Includes a **list of abbreviations and acronyms** where necessary


###  **2. Research Problem and Objectives**
- [ ] Clearly defines a **significant and novel research problem** with academic or industrial relevance
- [ ] At least _four_ contributions (**two major contributions** and **two minor contributions**) are mentioned and listed in the introduction
- [ ] Objectives are **precise, measurable, and aligned with the research problem**  
- [ ] Proposal explains why the problem is worth investigating and provides a **gap analysis**  


###  **3. Background and Literature Review**
- [ ] Provides sufficient **technical and theoretical background** for understanding the research context  
- [ ] Literature review _critically_ evaluates **key research papers, theories, and methodologies**  
- [ ] Identifies **gaps in existing work** and explains how the research will address them  
- [ ] Cites references correctly using the required citation style  
- [ ] Includes **state-of-the-art** publications (within the **last 2 years**)  
- [ ] Base papers are selected from **top-tier journals or conferences** in _computer science_  


###  **4. Proposed Methodology**
- [ ] Clearly outlines the **methodology** (_e.g._, system design, algorithm development, empirical study)  
- [ ] Specifies **data sources**, tools, technologies, frameworks, or programming languages used  
- [ ] Defines the **evaluation metrics or criteria** for success (_e.g._, scalability, accuracy, precision)  
- [ ] Identifies **limitations, assumptions, and challenges** in implementation  
- [ ] Utilizes appropriate **UML diagrams, flowcharts, or system architectures** for clarity  

###  **5. Expected Outcomes and Contributions**
- [ ] States the expected **scientific contributions** and their impact on the field of computer science  
- [ ] Explains how results will be validated (_e.g._, experimental testing, comparative analysis)  
- [ ] Discusses potential **real-world applications or societal impacts** of the research  

###  **6. Ethical and Practical Considerations**
- [ ] Addresses any **ethical concerns** related to data usage, privacy, security, or AI bias  
- [ ] Defines any **required approvals**, such as institutional ethics reviews (if applicable)  
- [ ] Confirms feasibility based on available **resources, time, and expertise**  

###  **7. Timeline and Work Plan**
- [ ] Presents a **comprehensive timeline** with milestones for each major phase (using a Gantt chart or similar)  
- [ ] Includes detailed phases such as literature review, methodology design, implementation, testing, and thesis writing  
- [ ] Demonstrates realistic scheduling to avoid delays  

###  **8. Writing Quality and Clarity**
- [ ] Ensures the proposal is **logically organized** with clear transitions between sections  
- [ ] Uses **formal, precise, and professional language** free from grammatical errors  
- [ ] Avoids redundancy and minimizes technical jargon where unnecessary  

###  **9. Supervisor-Specific Requirements**
- [ ] Meets all **departmental and supervisor guidelines**  
- [ ] Includes any additional **supporting materials** (_e.g._, appendices, technical feasibility reports)  
- [ ] The proposal has been proofread and reviewed multiple times for accuracy and coherence
