## Welcome to ISERL Checklists

Dear Students,

Welcome! I am honored that you have selected me as your referee, examiner, or thesis supervisor. Guiding you through this pivotal stage of your academic journey is a responsibility I take with great enthusiasm and dedication. My aim is to not only support you in meeting the requirements of your research but also to help you cultivate critical thinking, technical skills, and a professional approach that will serve you well beyond this thesis.

As your Supervisor/Examiner, I expect open and **consistent communication**, adherence to deadlines, and a commitment to producing high-quality work. In return, you can rely on me for guidance, constructive feedback, and mentorship throughout the research and writing process. I am here to support you in navigating challenges, refining your ideas, and ensuring that your thesis aligns with the highest academic standards.

I encourage you to approach this experience with curiosity, determination, and a willingness to embrace both the successes and learning moments that research inevitably brings. Together, we will work to ensure that your thesis not only fulfills academic expectations but also reflects your unique potential and the depth of your exploration into computer science.

Let us collaborate to make this journey a rewarding and enriching experience for your academic and professional growth.


Kind regards,

Morteza



## About ISERL Checklists

A checklist helps students improve the quality of their proposals and theses by ensuring they systematically address all critical components, reducing the risk of missing key elements.

Additionally, it encourages self-assessment and helps maintain clarity and coherence, leading to a well-organized and high-quality academic document.
